A game created in 72 hours for [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/) 33 for the theme "You are the Monster".

The game has been updated since the game jam release, but the original Ludum Dare entry version is preserved at https://walsh9.github.io/dragon-taxes/ld33-jam-version

## Description

A game where you are a dragon and you need to finish your tax return quickly. Pen and paper and calculator recommended.

## Mini FAQ

**Why are there no deductions?**

Dragons rarely actually spend their hoards, so they have no expenses to deduct.

**Why does a dragon have a smartphone?**

It's 2015.

**Is doing real taxes this hard?**

Well, the simplest United States income tax form, the 1040EZ, is two pages long and has 43 pages of instructions. But on the other hand, most people have longer than 10 minutes to work on it.

### How to print and play
1. Open the game. 
2. (optional) In your browser, go to your print settings and turn off headers and footers.
3. (optional) Do a print preview to make sure everything looks good. Should be around 20 pages.
4. From your browser menu, select print. Or try Ctrl+P or Command+P.
5. Wait for all the paper to come out.
6. Put aside the Answer Checker Table to remove temptation.
7. With scissors, cut out the appraisal reports and small complaint notes.
8. (optional) Set a timer. 
9. Lay out all the papers and fill out the D-1045 form as usual. This is the game!
10. When you're done, use the Answer Checker Table to check your answers and see how you did!

### Other modes

- Print multiple copies and race *against* a friend or friends.
